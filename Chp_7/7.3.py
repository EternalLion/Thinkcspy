"""Write a function which is given an exam mark, and it returns a string â€” the grade for that mark.

Mark	Grade
>= 90	A
[80-90)	B
[70-80)	C
[60-70)	D
< 60	F

The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals.
A closed interval includes the number, and open interval excludes it. So 79.99999 gets grade C , but 80 gets grade B.

Test your function by printing the mark and the grade for a number of different marks."""
